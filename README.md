# conch - an experiment in TUI

Blending shell, python, and ai in a single tool.

## What is it really?

First, a chat client for Anthropic Claude (other providers pending).

With '!' shell callouts.

With a simple text editor similar to `sam`.

With content-addressed storage.

## Inspired by:

- Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and all the other suchlike things
- Craig Muth's xiki project
- Plan9 `sam` editor
- Simon Willison's `llm` project

## Buyer Beware

This is very much experimental software. Expect changes.
