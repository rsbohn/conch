## Security Review: Anthropic API Key Handling

- The Anthropic API key is read from a file specified by the `keyfile` environment variable, not hardcoded or printed anywhere.
- The key is not exposed in logs or error messages.
- Main risks: insecure keyfile storage or environment variable leakage.
- Recommendations:
	- Store the keyfile securely (not in source control, restrict file permissions).
	- Never print or log the API key.
	- Set the environment variable only in secure environments.
	- Consider renaming to `ANTHROPIC_KEYFILE` for clarity.

No other obvious security issues found in the reviewed files. See: [src/conch/config.py](../src/conch/config.py), [src/conch/anthropic.py](../src/conch/anthropic.py)

## Summary
- Reviewed and updated tests for `conch.cas.CAS` and TUI help text.
- Removed outdated assertion for 'Ctrl+C' from help text tests.
- Added boundary tests to ensure help text accuracy and formatting.
- All tests passing after updates.
- Added AnthropicClient, integrated in TUI.

## Change: Wrap long lines in AI model response in TUI

- Updated `src/conch/tui.py` to wrap long lines in the AI model's response using `textwrap.wrap` before appending to the log view.
- Improves readability of output in the TUI log area.
- Added `import textwrap` to the file.

See: [src/conch/tui.py](../src/conch/tui.py)

## Details
- Verified that `CAS` class and its tests cover storage, retrieval, and pinning functionality.
- Ensured help text reflects current TUI commands and does not reference removed features.
- Confirmed robustness of help text with boundary checks (no empty text, proper formatting, no obsolete commands).

## Next Steps
- Consider further boundary and edge case tests for other modules.
- Continue improving test coverage and documentation.

## Next steps for a testing CAS:

- Add tests for unpinning, listing pins, and any other public methods.
- Test edge cases (e.g., duplicate pins, corrupted data).
- Test error handling for database failures.
- Test concurrency if relevant. NOTE: Not relevant at this point.
