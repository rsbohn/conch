# Devlog: 2025-08-16 Copilot

## Summary
- Reviewed and updated tests for `conch.cas.CAS` and TUI help text.
- Removed outdated assertion for 'Ctrl+C' from help text tests.
- Added boundary tests to ensure help text accuracy and formatting.
- All tests passing after updates.

## Details
- Verified that `CAS` class and its tests cover storage, retrieval, and pinning functionality.
- Ensured help text reflects current TUI commands and does not reference removed features.
- Confirmed robustness of help text with boundary checks (no empty text, proper formatting, no obsolete commands).

## Next Steps
- Consider further boundary and edge case tests for other modules.
- Continue improving test coverage and documentation.

## Next steps for a testing CAS:

- Add tests for unpinning, listing pins, and any other public methods.
- Test edge cases (e.g., duplicate pins, corrupted data).
- Test error handling for database failures.
- Test concurrency if relevant. NOTE: Not relevant at this point.
