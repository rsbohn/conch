# Devlog: CAS Implementation (2025-08-16)

## Summary
Implemented a Content-Address Store (CAS) for the project. The CAS provides efficient storage and retrieval of plaintext files using SHA-256 hashes as addresses. It supports three main operations: `put`, `get`, and `pin`.

## Details
- CAS root directory structure:
  - `index.db`: SQLite database for pinned hashes
  - `store/`: Content files organized by two-digit hash prefixes
- Only plaintext files are accepted; binaries and files over 4MB are rejected.
- `put(content)`: Stores content and returns its hash
- `get(hash)`: Retrieves content by hash
- `pin(hash)`: Marks content as pinned in the database
- Comprehensive tests added for all operations

## Next Steps
- Integrate CAS with other modules
- Add CLI or TUI support for CAS operations
- Monitor performance and storage usage
