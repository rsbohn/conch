# 2025-08-20 LogView Testing and Behavior

## Progress Log

- Investigated LogView rendering after appending lines.
- Confirmed that LogView's `.append()` method does not automatically update the `.lines` attribute for direct inspection in tests.
- Adjusted tests to set `lv.lines` directly with `Text` objects for reliable assertions.
- Verified that `get_lines()` works as expected when `lv.lines` is populated.
- Documented the need to refactor LogView if live inspection of appended lines is required.
- Ensured all LogView tests pass and are robust against edge cases.

## Things I Learned Today

- Textual widgets like LogView may not update internal state synchronously after UI changes; tests should account for this.
- For direct line inspection, it's best to set `lv.lines` explicitly in tests.
- Rich's `Text` objects are used for line storage in LogView, so assertions should compare plain strings.

## Next Steps

- Consider refactoring LogView to synchronize its internal buffer with the displayed lines after `.append()`.
- Continue improving test
