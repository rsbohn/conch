# 2025-08-18: /w Slash Command Added to TUI

## Summary
- Implemented a new `/w` slash command in the TUI (`src/conch/tui.py`).
- The command saves the current buffer to the CAS (Content Addressable Storage).
- The busy indicator is updated with the resultant hash after saving.

## Relevant Code
- [src/conch/tui.py](../src/conch/tui.py): Handles the `/w` command logic and busy indicator update.
- [src/conch/cas.py](../src/conch/cas.py): Implements the CAS storage and hash generation.

## Notes
- Manual edits were made to `src/conch/tui.py` after initial implementation.
- The feature is now available for use in the TUI.
