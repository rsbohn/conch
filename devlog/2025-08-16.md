> An address identifies a substring in a file. In the following, ‘character n’ means the null string after the n-th character in the file, with 1 the first character in the file. ‘Line n’ means the n-th match, starting at the beginning of the file, of the regular expression .*\n?. All files always have a current substring, called dot, that is the default address.
