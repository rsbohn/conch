## Busy Indicator

In the AI mode when I submit a prompt it is hard to tell
that we're waiting for the response. It just looks like
the app ate my input and is ready for the next thing.

Let's add a busy indicator while we're waiting for the
response from the LLM.

Tried to use LoadingIndicator. Too complicated.

Wound up using a Static and updating the text.

Much clearer what is going on now.
