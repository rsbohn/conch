Did some Codex work earlier. Now time to refactor here and there.

## Refactor: TUI and Commands
- Extracted `LogView` class from `tui.py` to `logview.py`.
- Moved all slash command implementations from `tui.py` to `commands.py`.
- Moved the `LOREM` constant to `commands.py` and updated references.
- Updated TUI to delegate slash commands to functions in `commands.py`.
- Verified with tests and manual review.

See:
- [`src/conch/logview.py`](../src/conch/logview.py)
- [`src/conch/commands.py`](../src/conch/commands.py)
- [`src/conch/tui.py`](../src/conch/tui.py)
