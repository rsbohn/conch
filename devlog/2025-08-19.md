# 2025-08-19

Did some Codex work earlier. Now time to refactor here and there.

## Refactor: TUI and Commands
- Extracted `LogView` class from `tui.py` to `logview.py`.
- Moved all slash command implementations from `tui.py` to `commands.py`.
- Moved the `LOREM` constant to `commands.py` and updated references.
- Updated TUI to delegate slash commands to functions in `commands.py`.
- Verified with tests and manual review.

See:
- [`src/conch/logview.py`](../src/conch/logview.py)
- [`src/conch/commands.py`](../src/conch/commands.py)
- [`src/conch/tui.py`](../src/conch/tui.py)


## 2025-08-19 Updates
- Switched mode toggle from single key to hot-key (F9) in TUI.
- Updated key binding in `src/conch/tui.py` to use F9 for mode switching.
- Removed single-key switching logic from input handler.
- `/q` and `/quit` commands are now handled directly in `tui.py` (no external call).
- Ran code formatter (black) on `src/conch/tui.py` for style consistency.
